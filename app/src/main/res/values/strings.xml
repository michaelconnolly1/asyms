        <p>Cancer starts in our cells. Cells are tiny building blocks that make up the organs and tissues of our body. Usually, these cells divide to make new cells in a controlled way. This is how our bodies grow, heal and repair.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, this goes wrong and the cell becomes abnormal. The abnormal cell keeps dividing and making more and more abnormal cells. These cells form a lump, which is called a tumour.</p>
        <p>Not all lumps are cancerous.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A lump that is not cancerous (benign) cannot spread to anywhere else in the body.</li>
        <li>A lump that is cancer (malignant) can grow into surrounding tissue.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cancer cells sometimes break away from the primary cancer and travel through the blood or lymphatic system to other parts of the body. Cancer cells that spread and develop into a tumour somewhere else in the body are called a secondary cancer.</p>

        <p><b>We know that the biggest fear of many bowel cancer patients is that your cancer will come back, either in your bowel or in other parts of your body.</b></p>
        <p>Many people describe how they become anxious before follow-up appointments, and that going back for clinic appointments and waiting for test results can be stressful. Even visiting the hospital again can create anxiety for some people.</p>
        <p>Your colorectal specialist team will help you to understand your individual risk of the cancer coming back, based on your original diagnosis â€“ the type and stage of cancer at that time. The follow-up tests described on page 6 will allow your hospital team to monitor you. If anything is identified in these tests, a review at a colorectal multi-disciplinary team meeting will determine if further tests are necessary.</p>
        <p><b>Any recurrence is usually picked up by routine tests, rather than any signs and symptoms you may notice yourself. However, if you do have symptoms, including those listed below, do get in touch with your GP or colorectal specialist nurse:</b></p>

        <p><b>Regular follow-up is offered to all patients with primary bowel cancer who have had treatment to cure the cancer. This starts with a clinic visit four to six weeks after your operation. You should be offered regular surveillance which may include:</b></p>
        <ul>
        <li>at least two CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis in the first three years</li>
        <li>regular CEA (blood) tests at least every six months in the first three years</li>
        <li>a surveillance colonoscopy at one year after initial treatment or sooner if you did not have one before surgery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Follow-up appointments with your surgical team and then your colorectal nurse specialist are important opportunities to voice any concerns and describe ongoing symptoms if you have them. At these appointments, you may:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>discuss how you are feeling both physically and psychologically</li>
        <li>discuss your test results</li>
        <li>agree plans to investigate or treat problems with symptoms or changes in your body</li>
        <li>be referred to other services to help you manage other non-cancer symptoms or problems</li>
        <li>discuss your follow-up pathway.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At your appointment with your colorectal nurse specialist you will be able to discuss any problems and complete a holistic needs assessment (HNA) form, which will be revisited regularly to help shape your rehabilitation and recovery care plan.</p>
        <p>A good holistic needs assessment not only gathers useful information about you and how you are feeling, but can also be therapeutic in its own right. Sometimes a conversation with the nurse will be enough to reassure you. You may require a referral for further help, for example to the local cancer centre or dietitian. The HNA form, which you should be given to complete, will ask you to identify any problems you may be having such as wound healing, pain, changes in bowel habit, diet, energy levels, sleep quality, mobility, coping with day-to-day activities, personal relationships, and any other problems or concerns.</p>
        <p>Your hospital team will follow their local guidelines to ensure that you continue to be monitored in the most appropriate way for you. </p>
        <p>Throughout your treatment, your GP will have received letters from your hospital team. Your GP is in charge of your care when you are not receiving active treatment from your surgeon, oncologist or palliative care team. Your GP is also required to carry out a cancer care review with you within six months of your diagnosis.</p>

As your family and friends return to their own daily routines, it may be hard for you to fit back into your old life, and you may start to look back on everything that has happened to you.</b></p>
        <p>Some days you may feel that you are recovering well; but other days may be a struggle, leaving you feeling low. After the regular contact of treatment, you may feel isolated and lonely, as if youâ€™ve been abandoned.</p>
        <p>After the shock of diagnosis and the demands of treatment it can also be a relief to be feeling more normal and looking forward to a more comfortable and healthy future, but it can also be a time of mixed emotions.

        <p>Patience ... </p>
        <p><i>Everybody who recovers from treatment is always surprised at how long it takes before they feel back to their old self. Medically you may recover in a few months. Psychologically it can take longer before the fatigue finally wears off. Try to give yourself lots of time to recover. Donâ€™t be in a hurry. You will make most of the progress early on â€“ but give yourself time to recover fully. Itâ€™s worth having a one-year or a even a two-year plan for getting back on your feet.

        <p><b>Illness, treatment and surgery can all take their toll on your energy levels, making you feel very tired and lethargic. Worry and uncertainty associated with your cancer diagnosis are likely to have given you several sleepless nights, and spending time in hospital can often disrupt your sleeping patterns.</b></p>
        <p>Itâ€™s not unusual to find that this can be the start of longer-term problems with insomnia, low energy levels or a really deep fatigue that can last for many months after treatment finishes. Tiredness may be linked to other problems, untreated symptoms like pain or anaemia, or other changes in your body. Stress and anxiety can also take their toll and make it difficult to get to sleep, or cause you to wake up again in the small hours of the morning.</p>
        <p>If your bowel cancer diagnosis is causing you so much anxiety that you just cannot sleep, itâ€™s worth talking to your GP about self-help strategies or complementary therapies. If necessary, they can refer you to a counsellor or mental health professional, or prescribe medication.</p>
        <p>As we get older, sleep can be disturbed by a need to use the toilet and this can be a particular problem after bowel cancer treatment. If you find frequency or urgency of bowel movements during the night is disturbing your sleep, you may wish to talk to your GP about medication such as loperamide to slow your digestion down.</p>
        <p>The worry that you are not getting enough sleep can itself be a problem. If you find yourself awake in the night, tell yourself that relaxing can be as refreshing as sleep. Lie quietly and donâ€™t keep looking at the clock. Allow your thoughts to drift away and focus on things that make you feel happy. A relaxation or meditation CD or podcast can be a way to take your mind off the fact that you are not sleeping and you may actually drift off.</p>
        <p><b>Good sleep habits:</b></p>

        <li>Avoid caffeinated drinks (coffee, tea, cola) for at least four hours before bedtime â€“ try a cup of herbal tea instead.</li>

        <li>There is evidence of a link between excessive consumption of red meat (beef, lamb, pork) and bowel cancer, so we recommend that you aim for less than 500g (cooked weight) a week. The research linking processed meats (e.g. bacon, ham, salami) with bowel cancer is even stronger, so we recommend cutting down on these as much as possible.</li>
        <li>If consumed at all, alcoholic drinks should be limited to two small drinks for men and one for women a day. For cancer prevention, the best recommendation is not to drink any alcohol at all.</li>

        <p><b>If you have been diagnosed â€“ and treated â€“ for bowel cancer, then you may also have noticed that it has altered your appetite or your ability to enjoy certain foods and drinks that used to be favourites.</b></p>
        <p>Food is important to us in so many different ways â€“ eating and sharing food can bring us great pleasure and make us feel better about ourselves.</p>
        <p>This section aims to give bowel cancer patients â€“ and their families and carers â€“ some clear guidance on what to expect at each stage of the cancer journey. It explains in simple terms how your appetite and digestive system can be affected by the illness, and what to expect from the side-effects of the different types of treatment you might have. It can take time for your body to settle down again after treatment. For some, it can be a process of â€˜trial and errorâ€™, sometimes for many months, or longer. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to make these changes, so all our suggestions are based on the experiences of our Bowel Cancer Voices and members of our online patient forum.</p>
        <p>We aim to help you find new ways of eating and enjoying your food. These simple tips and pieces of trusted advice have already helped many people to reduce problems associated with their diet and to overcome the unexpected side-effects of a disrupted digestive system. We hope that they will help you too.</p>

        <p><b>Problems with changes in your bowel habit after you complete your treatment can be so frustrating; you just want your life to go back to normal, and that includes your bodily functions.</b></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, your treatment will have had an impact on the way your bowel functions. Scars form as a natural part of the healing process but these can sometimes cause some narrowing around the area where the bowel has been re-joined. Bands of tough tissue called adhesions may also form as a result of your surgery.</p>
        <p>Radiotherapy can also affect the bowel, making it more sensitive and prone to inflammation in the area, which can take some time to settle back down again. The muscles in your abdomen which would normally massage your bowel, helping it to move food waste along, may be weaker and not as efficient immediately after surgery. Regular gentle exercise such as walking will help to regain tone, and reduce bloating and constipation.</p>
        <h5>Why is it important to eat well before and after surgery?</h5>
        <p>Surgery can take its toll on your body and ensuring a well-balanced diet in preparation for surgery is one way you can help speed up your recovery. Foods high in protein can aid the healing process and lower the risk of wound infection. Carbohydrates supply much-needed energy which, in turn, can help earlier mobilisation, potentially reducing some post-operative complications.</p>
        <p>Many hospitals now have an Enhanced Recovery Programme, where you will be offered carbohydrate-rich drinks to take, usually from about three days before until two hours before your operation, and for a few days after the operation too. This has shown to promote faster healing and recovery.</p>
        <p>It may be worth preparing some meals before you go into hospital and freezing them so you have healthy meals ready at a time when you may not feel like cooking.</p>
        <p>Both before and after surgery it is wise to eat small frequent meals or top up your regular meals with nutritious snacks and drinks.</p>
        <p>Protein-rich foods include meat, fish, chicken, eggs and cheese; and carbohydrate-rich foods include potatoes, bread, cereal, rice and pasta, so aim to combine both in your meals. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>fish finger sandwich</li>
        <li>ham/corned beef sandwich</li>
        <li>sardines on toast</li>
        <li>eggs on toast</li>
        <li>cheese on toast/crackers</li>
        <li>cheese sauce with fish and pasta.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>In the early stages of recovery after surgery, your bowel will be very sensitive and you may have to make small changes to your diet. </b></p>
        <p>You may be recommended to follow a low-fibre diet, explained in the next section. Having too much fibre, too quickly, in your food can cause problems with wind and diarrhoea or bloating, and you may want to consider ways in which you can avoid foods which are more difficult to digest while your bowel is still healing. These might include fruit and vegetables with tough skins, or foods that need a lot of chewing to break them down before you swallow them. You should be able to gradually reintroduce these foods, although it can take some time to establish a new bowel pattern.</p>
        <p>There can also be problems associated with pain around the operation site, although this usually settles in time, and can be helped with medicines to help reduce the discomfort. If you are concerned, talk to your colorectal specialist nurse or stoma nurse specialist.</p>
        <p>Sitting still, especially for long periods, can cause discomfort and potentially lead to other long-term problems. You can avoid this by getting up or changing position regularly, every 20-30 minutes, especially while you are healing. This will also help to avoid a build-up of wind that can get trapped in the bowel, causing more pain and discomfort.</p>
        <h5>Tips to avoid wind and pain</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>eat and drink slowly in a relaxed environment, taking time to chew foods well</li>
        <li>eat at regular intervals, and donâ€™t eat on the move or skip meals</li>
        <li>donâ€™t expect to get back to normal overnight â€“ it will take time</li>
        <li>donâ€™t worry too much â€“ over time you can balance your diet out as your bowel recovers</li>
        <li>drink water, little and often </li>
        <li>avoid â€˜windyâ€™ foods such as beans, pickles and fizzy drinks</li>
        <li>introduce spicy foods slowly</li>
        <li>try charcoal tablets or peppermint water/tea, or peppermint oil capsules</li>
        <li>take regular exercise</li>
        <li>try to stop smoking.</li>

        <p><b>Fibre is only found in foods that come from plants. There are two types: insoluble and soluble fibre.</b></p>
        <ul>
        <li><b><i>Insoluble fibre:</i></b> The body canâ€™t digest this type of fibre so it passes through the bowel, helping other food and waste products move through the bowel more easily. Wholegrain bread and breakfast cereals, brown rice, and  wheat pasta are good sources.</li>
        <li><b><i>Soluble fibre:</i></b> This type of fibre can be partly digested and may help reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood. Oats and pulses are good examples.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means that a <b><i>low-fibre diet</i></b> will reduce the amount of undigested material that passes through your bowel. It also helps to rest the bowel after surgery to enhance healing.</p>
        <p>A <b><i>low-residue diet</i></b> is  restrictive than a low-fibre diet and, in addition to the guidance here regarding low fibre diet, you should avoid caffeine, limit dairy produce to a maximum of two servings a day, and avoid raw fruits of any kind. Both low-residue or low-fibre diets may be advised for around six weeks after bowel surgery and for those patients who have had a colonic stent inserted. It helps by reducing the size and frequency of your stools thereby minimising abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea, and inflammation around the site of the operation or stent. If you need help with this your colorectal nurse, stoma nurse or dietician can advise you.</p>
        <p>After six weeks you can gradually start to introduce small amounts of soluble fibre foods back into your diet, ensuring you are drinking plenty of fluids as you do so. You could start with peeled apples, pears and oats.</p>
